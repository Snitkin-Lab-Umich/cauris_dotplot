# cauris_dotplot
This script takes input assemblies (in the form of .fasta files) and generates dot plots from them. In order to run this script on the Great Lakes cluster, load these modules first:

module load Bioinformatics mummer/4.0.0rc1

module load R/4.4.0

Also ensure you have ggplot installed in R. A sample reference fasta is included in the reference folder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_002759435.3/).
